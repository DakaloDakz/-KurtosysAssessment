To run the selenium project you need to import the project to eclipse.
Must add selenium jar file and also testNG jar file
Also add testNG user libraries
Goto testNg XML file right click and run project as testNG
So on this projest i'm using testng and remote webdriver to control the browser session so all the test run on one session i don't close the browser in order for another test to run.
API ASSESSMENT
Just import the project to postman and run it from there.NB under test please remove the size and time that i've added
